# Beam Diffraction Visualizer

This project is designed to visualize the diffraction patterns generated by different types of beams passing through various apertures. The application allows users to adjust beam parameters, aperture parameters, rendering range, and propagation distance. Additionally, users can select the type of beam and aperture from dropdown menus.
