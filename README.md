# Beam Diffraction Visualizer

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to visualize the diffraction patterns generated by different types of beams passing through various apertures. The application allows users to adjust beam parameters, aperture parameters, rendering range, and propagation distance using sliders. Additionally, users can select the type of beam and aperture from dropdown menus.

## Features

- **Beam Types**: Supports various beam types including ideal plane wave, Gaussian beam, elliptical Gaussian beam, and Laguerre-Gaussian beam.
- **Aperture Types**: Includes different aperture types such as ideal single slit, ideal multi-slit, ideal grating, rectangular aperture, circular aperture, and elliptical aperture.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Users can adjust parameters such as beam width, aperture size, rendering range, and propagation distance.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: The application updates the diffraction pattern in real-time based on user inputs.
